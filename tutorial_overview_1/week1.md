Week 1 - Practical
=====================

Please find your [groups](https://theheking.github.io/babs-rna-seq/key_info/) again .

Each group is paired up with a [dataset](https://theheking.github.io/babs-rna-seq/practical_overview/sample_datasets/) eg. Group 1 will be doing neuroblastomas. 

The structure of today's session is to:

1. Run through any Q and A from your practical
- *** If you are having issues please bring up any errors. If we don't know the answer we can work it out. ***

2. To download and read through your paper within your group

3. Start to work on your oral presentation within your groups

You will be assigned RNA sequencing datasets and randomly allocated into groups to prepare your oral presentation where you will discuss 
the importance of analysing your dataset to advance research and provide knowledge about human disease. 
Talks are 10 minutes plus 5 minutes for questions, with slides presented by each team member live on Teams in the week 5 Practical timeslot 
and will be graded by peers. See course Handbook for more details. [Taken from King Handbook 2023]
