Some Time Saving Shortcuts If you have any extra time here are a couple of things to do to make your login and navigating around your user login easier.

Login without using ssh without a password (https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/11/3-steps-to-perform-ssh-login-without-password-using-ssh-keygen-ssh-copy-id/)
